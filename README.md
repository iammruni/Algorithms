# Machine Learning by Andrew Ng from Stanford University
This is a tutorial series on how to implement various weeks of the course on actual data which will provide a better insight on how Machine Learning actually works.
Whichever week's code you check out, it assumes that you have already done that particular week in Ng's course.
All the best! Hope you get all your doubts cleared after actually implementing what you learn.
The dataset used in this can be found on my 'datasets' repo.
